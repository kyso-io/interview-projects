## Kyso UX engineer project


- Create a dashboard that shows a list of the reports (the report data is in the attached reports.json).
- Solution should be responsive.
- Make sure that all the main data is visible, name, description, owner, preview image etc.
- Make sure that you show the number of views, number of comments and stars as well.
- Allow editing of:
    - name
    - description
    - tags
    - stars
    - views
- the edits do not need to persist through a server restart.
- Use whatever mechanism you like for storing and editing state, (fyi Kyso uses redux internally, but React.Context is also a good choice, among others)

Some notes on how to do this project:
  - If there is something wrong, and you can't solve it in the frontend, explain what's the problem (comments in the code or via email)
  - the above project will show us your javascript skills - but it should not be too difficult to implement from a pure functional perspective, what we are really aiming for here is to keep the project simple to give you space to express your UX and design skills. So feel free to go crazy!
